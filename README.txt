ES432 Game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

This game will be a 2d map scroller-like game, featuring our protagonist, the midshipman.
The midshipman will be a small 8-bit sprite that will be able to wander around a screen and interact with the world around him.
The screen size will not change, but there will be different rooms the midshipman will be able to roam into.
Once he reaches the edge of the current room, if there is another room located in the direction he is travelling, he will move into that room.
Otherwise he will simply collide with the wall and move nowhere.

The objective is simple: make it back to your rack in Bancroft avoiding the officers, and picking up food scattered randomly on the way.
If the midshipman goes too long without finding food, he will become hungry and his movement will gradually slow until he comes to a complete stop.
If this happens, fatigue has won and the player loses the game.
If an officer, another NPC that randomly roams the entire map, runs into the player then he also immediately loses.

The whole map will be randomly generated every instance of the game (i.e. the orientation of the rooms), and so will the officers, snacks, and location of the food.
It is the player's goal to wander through the rooms until he finds his rack, and lays his weary head to sleep before peril befalls him.
